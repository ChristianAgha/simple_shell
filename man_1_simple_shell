.SH NAME
.B BombShell, hsh - a command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.I hsh [command] [arg] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
BombShell (hsh) replicates the command language interpreter (sh) and executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.\ 


.SH OVERVIEW
Bombshell (hsh) is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and genreally executes other commands.\ 
It is a program that is running when the user compiles BombShell (simple_shell) and runs the excutable file, ./hsh.\
The simple_shell implements a language that has flow control constructs. It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage \
that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). \
That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell. 

.SH INVOCATION
To start up BombShell, you must first compile with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh and run the executable ./hsh.
If no arguments are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered an interactive shell.  
BombShell is designed to interact in Linux or a Unix like system since the shell uses the Linux system calls to retrieve and execute executable programs found in the $PATH.\
Our version of the shell incorporates the builtin commands "exit" and "env".
